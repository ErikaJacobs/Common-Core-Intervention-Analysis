# An Intervention Analysis of Common Core Curriculum
This repository features project files for a a time series intervention analysis of average mathematical SAT score before and after the implementation of Common Core curriculum. Time series analysis was utilized in R Studio to compare forecasted versus actual SAT scores post Common Core implementation using SAT score data from the College Board for the state of New York. This was the capstone project for my masters degree.
